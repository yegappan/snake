1. INTRODUCTION                                            *snake-intro*

Snake is a classic arcade game implemented in Vim9script. Guide a growing
snake around a grid to eat prey (numbers 1-9 in sequence). Each time you eat
a number, the snake grows longer and you move to the next number. The game
ends if the snake collides with a wall, itself, or completes all 9 numbers.

The game runs in a centered popup window and supports both arrow keys and
hjkl navigation for movement.

2. INSTALLATION                                       *snake-install*

Requirements~

This plugin requires Vim 9.0 or later with Vim9 script support enabled.
It will not work with Neovim or older versions of Vim.

Installation~

Using Git~
If you have git installed, run the following command in your terminal:

    Unix/Linux/macOS: >
      git clone https://github.com/yegappan/snake.git ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/snake
<
    Windows (cmd.exe): >
      git clone https://github.com/yegappan/snake.git %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt\snake
<
Using a ZIP file~
If you prefer not to use Git:

    Unix/Linux/macOS:
    1. Create the destination directory: >

	 mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/
<
    2. Download the plugin ZIP file from GitHub and extract its contents into
       the directory created above.

       *Note:* GitHub usually names the extracted folder snake-main.
       Rename it to snake so the final path looks like this: >

	 ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/snake/
	 ├── plugin/
	 ├── autoload/
	 └── doc/
<
    Windows (cmd.exe):
    1. Create the destination directory: >

	 if not exist "%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt" mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt"
<
    2. Download the plugin ZIP file from GitHub and extract its contents into
       that directory.

       *Note:* Rename the extracted folder (usually snake-main) to
       snake so the path matches: >

	 %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt\snake\
	 ├── plugin/
	 ├── autoload/
	 └── doc/

Finalizing Setup~
Since this plugin is installed in the opt (optional) directory, it will not
load automatically. Add the following line to your .vimrc (Unix) or _vimrc
(Windows): >

    packadd snake
<
After adding the line, restart Vim and run the following command to enable the
help documentation: >

    :helptags ALL
<
Plugin Manager Installation~

If using a plugin manager like vim-plug, add to your .vimrc or init.vim:
>
    Plug 'path/to/snake'
<
Then run `:PlugInstall` and `:helptags ALL`

For other plugin managers (Vundle, Pathogen, etc.), follow their standard
installation procedures for local plugins.

3. COMMANDS                                           *snake-commands*

:SnakeGame
    Start a new Snake game in a popup window.

================================================================================
4. CONTROLS                                            *snake-controls*

Movement:
  h or <Left>     Move snake left
  l or <Right>    Move snake right
  k or <Up>       Move snake up
  j or <Down>     Move snake down

Game Control:
  r               Restart after game over
  q               Quit/close the game

Note: The snake moves continuously once a direction is set. Rapid key presses
allow you to change direction before the next movement tick.

================================================================================
5. GAME RULES                                          *snake-rules*

Objective~
Guide the snake to eat prey in sequential order (1 through 9). Avoid colliding
with walls or the snake's own body.

How to Play~
1. The game starts with a small snake in the center of the grid
2. Prey appears as numbers on the grid
3. Navigate the snake to eat numbers in order: 1, 2, 3... up to 9
4. Each number eaten makes the snake longer
5. Continue until you eat all 9 numbers or the snake dies

Win Condition~
Successfully eat all 9 numbers in sequence without hitting walls or yourself.

Lose Condition~
Game ends if:
  • The snake hits a wall (grid boundary)
  • The snake hits its own body
  • At any point, no more prey is available

================================================================================
6. STRATEGY TIPS                                         *snake-strategy*

Movement Patterns~
  • Move in predictable patterns to avoid trapping yourself
  • Circle the grid edges before moving to the center
  • Never allow your body to block the path to food

Planning Ahead~
  • Always plan at least 2-3 moves ahead
  • Look for food that won't trap you in a corner
  • Use the full grid area to give yourself escape routes

Avoid Common Mistakes~
  • Don't chase diagonal prey - plan a logical path
  • Keep segments of your body spread out, not clustered
  • Never back yourself into a dead end
  • Use wall bounces strategically (snake wraps around edges)

Progression~
  • Start slowly to understand movement mechanics
  • Build speed gradually as you gain confidence
  • The snake accelerates after eating multiple prey
  • Higher numbered prey items may appear in difficult positions

7. VIM9 SCRIPT FEATURES                               *snake-vim9*

This plugin demonstrates several modern Vim9script capabilities:

Classes~
  • Snake: Manages snake body, direction, and growth logic
  • Board: Grid representation and collision detection
  • Game: Core game state and turn progression
  • PopupView: Popup window creation and rendering

Type System~
  • Type annotations for all function parameters and return types
  • Enums for direction constants (Up, Down, Left, Right)
  • Type aliases for semantic clarity (Position, Cell, etc.)

Features~
  • Popup windows for centered, distraction-free gameplay
  • Event-driven key handling with hjkl/arrow navigation
  • Modular architecture separating game logic from UI rendering
  • Clean separation of concerns across dedicated modules

Design Patterns~
  • Singleton pattern for game instance management
  • Model-View separation for clean architecture
  • State machine for game phases (Playing, GameOver, Victory)

================================================================================
8. CONFIGURATION                                       *snake-config*

The Snake plugin has minimal configuration. The game behavior is fixed:

• Grid size: 10x10 cells (standard Arcade Snake)
• Prey sequence: 1-9 (fixed)
• Movement speed: Continuous (adjustable by player key frequency)
• Collision detection: Walls and self-collision end game

Gameplay Customization~

While the plugin itself has no configuration variables, you can modify
game behavior by:
  • Adjusting how quickly you press keys to control snake speed
  • Practicing different movement patterns
  • Playing multiple games to improve positioning

For future enhancement, the modular architecture would support adding:
  • Custom grid sizes
  • Variable game speeds
  • Different prey counts
  • Custom color schemes
