# Vim Snake Game

A Vim9script snake game that runs in a popup window. The snake moves
continuously and must eat numbers 1-9 in order. Each number grows the snake.
The game ends if the snake hits a wall, hits itself, or after eating 9.

## Installation

### Using Git
If you have git installed, run the following command in your terminal:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yegappan/snake.git ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/snake
```
**Windows (cmd.exe):**

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/yegappan/snake.git %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt\snake
```

### Using a ZIP file
If you prefer not to use Git:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**

Create the destination directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/
```

Download the plugin ZIP file from GitHub and extract its contents into the directory created above.

*Note:* GitHub usually names the extracted folder snake-main. Rename it to snake so the final path looks like this:

```plaintext
~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/snake/
├── plugin/
├── autoload/
└── doc/
```

**Windows (cmd.exe):**

Create the destination directory:

```cmd
if not exist "%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt" mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt"
```

Download the plugin ZIP file from GitHub and extract its contents into that directory.

*Note:* Rename the extracted folder (usually snake-main) to snake so the path matches:

```plaintext
%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt\snake\
├── plugin/
├── autoload/
└── doc/
```

### Finalizing Setup
Since this plugin is installed in the opt (optional) directory, it will not load automatically. Add the following line to your .vimrc (Unix) or _vimrc (Windows):

```viml
packadd snake
```

After adding the line, restart Vim and run the following command to enable the help documentation:

```viml
:helptags ALL
```

### Plugin Manager Installation

If using a plugin manager like vim-plug, add to your .vimrc or init.vim:

   ```viml
   Plug 'path/to/snake'
   ```

Then run `:PlugInstall` and `:helptags ALL`

For other plugin managers (Vundle, Pathogen, etc.), follow their standard
installation procedures for local plugins.
